### Best Build

The Marechaussee Hunter Set is the most suitable build for Neuvillette. Its 2-piece Bonus gives an additional 15% Normal and Charged Attack damage, while its 4-Piece Bonus increases the crit rate by 12% each time the HP increases or decreases in under 5 seconds. This can be stacked up to 3 staccks. For the stats, we are  looking for Crit Rate and Damage, primarily focussing on Crit Damage. HP% and Energy Recharge is also needed.

 ## Best Weapon

Neuvillette's signature weapon, the Tome of the Eternal Flow, has a main stat of Crit Damage. At refinement 1, its passive gives a 16% HP% increase when the HP is gained or lost. Charged attack damage is increased by 14% for 3 seconds which stacks up to 3 times. This effect is triggered eveyr 0.3 seconds. Once the stacks reach 3, the user gains elemental energy 8 times. This effect can only happen once every 12 seconds.\
